    <h2>Negative effects of Fast Food</h2>
    <p>It is common knowledge that fast food isn't healthy. The amount of time it takes, the quality of the ingredients all make it obvious that the food isn't healthy at all. The question is, just how unhealthy is fast food?</p>
    <p>In a certain documentary called super size me, a man decided to only eat mcdonalds food for 30 days. The doctors said that it would be fine, but it certainly wasn't fine as the results showed some serious problems in the mans body. He had gained 24 pounds, got addicted (he got headaches without having a mcdonalds meal), and got heart palpitations. It took the man 14 months to get back to his normal weight. Other than this, there have been several people who have gotten Escherichia coli ,a bacterial disease transmitted from eating undercooked burgers and died.</p>
