    <h2>How is Fast Food made so fast?</h2>
    <p>If you have eaten fast food before, you would generally notice that the food comes out very fast. Most people know that the ingredients aren't very fresh and that the food is premade. Although those statements are true, there are many other factors in how the food is made fast.</p>
<p>Fast food restaurants generally have a very large grill where one person could cook lots of burgers simultaneously, a dressing station where people added the same condiments to every burger,a fryer where one person made french fries, a soda fountain and milkshake machine for desserts and beverages, and a  counter where customers placed and received their orders. Fast food restaurants also usually have short-order cooks who specialize at making food that don't take a long time to make. </p>

  <p>The meat in burgers are cooked in big grills like these, so that multiple patties can be cooked at once</p>
