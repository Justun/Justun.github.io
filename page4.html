    <h2>Limit Yourself</h2>
    <p>If you have read all my previous writings, you should know that fast food isn't healthy. That being said, you don't have to stop eating fast food because it is bad for you. A burger once in a while won't really affect, but it is very important to limit yourself.</p>
    <p>One of the negative effects of eating too much fast food was addiction. The feeling of needing to eat fast food. In order to prevent this from happening you should limit yourself to how much fast food you eat, and how often. Doing this will greatly help you in being more healhy and staying fit.</p>

    <p>Even if you eat fast food rarely, be aware of the portions you are getting.</p>
